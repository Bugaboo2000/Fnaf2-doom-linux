# About

Fnaf2 doom mod is a mod made on GZDoom, AKA using the Doom1 engine modified. This mod is made originally by  [Skornedemon](https://gamejolt.com/@Skornedemon) and uploaded in Gamejolt.





## The repo

The plan is to make easier to play Fnaf2 Doom on Linux or make easier to create a dedicated server with this mod, but i originaly  made this repository to work with my Lutris script.
