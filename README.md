### Common issues

#### Game not starting ‚ùå

If your game not opening or showing **Glx errors** in logs, this means that your graphics card does not have **Opengl 3.3 support**. For older graphics cards, try running with this [version](https://github.com/Bugaboo2000/Fnaf2-doom-linux/releases/tag/1.0) or run with *Lzdoom*

#### No Audioüîá

If your game not playing the sounds, make sure you have [OpenAL](https://openal.org/) installed.

#### Important‚ö†Ô∏è

I not modified the original mod assets, this *modifications is only to run properly on Linux* and work together in Lutris script. Downloading source code not work due to git 100mb limitations.
