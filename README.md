This is a simple Linux port changing simple things like swithing .bat file to sh and adding Linux version of the Doom engine.







## the Repo 

This is a simple port to make easier to play Fnaf2 Doom on Linux or make easier to create a dedicated server with this mod, but i originaly  made this repository to work with my Lutris script.
