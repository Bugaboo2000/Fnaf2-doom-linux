While this is the release version, bugs are expected, be warned.

To play the game, you need to download gzdoom, or you can play in Lutris
 and simply run the FNAF2-Host.sh args withtout "gzdoom" parameter file with "Netmode 0" and "Host 1" set in the sh file
(You can edit .bat files via notepad)

This includes playing it in singleplayer, currently running the actual singleplayer in doom without
hosting a netgame causes the level to crash after completetion. You can host even without internet so it
shouldn't stop you from playing 'singleplayer'

NOTE:DONT FORGET YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RESOLUTION IN OPTIONS->SET VIDEO MODE. SOMETIMES 1080P DOESN'T APPEAR, FEAR NOT.
IF 1080P DOESNT APPEAR, OPEN 'zdoom-YOURCOMPUTERNAME.ini' in Notepad(This file appears once gzdoom has launched once), search for vid_defheight and vid_defwidth and change it to:
vid_defheight=1080
vid_defwidth=1920

*::::*To host a netgame*::::*, simply edit the number after "Host" in the .Bat to the number of players expected.
The game currently only supports up to 8 players.

If you find that your internet cannot handle 4-8 players, then change "Netmode" to 1 in the .Bat

For people joining, simply edit the JOIN .bat file in notepad and edit the IP to the host's IP.

To change your character, you have to set your character via singleplayer DOOM. NOT THE PLAYER SETUP.
Run FNAF.Bat and choose single player,choose a character,let the level load,then quit the game.
You will then have that character for netgames.

*********************NOTE*******************
You can change the night you begin at by changing the 'E1M1' in the Host bat file. E1M2 is Night 2,E1M6 is Night 6, etc.
It is not recommended to go beyond E1M6, as you'll be in a normal Doom level at that point(And warping to normal
DOOM levels could have issues when going back to the FNAF levels and it is recommended to simply restart GZDOOM.)

**CHALLENGE LEVELS**
THESE LEVELS ARE MEANT STRICTLY AS CHALLENGE. THE AIs CAN BE MORE DEADLY THAN ON NIGHT 6, BE WARNED.
E2M1 - New and Shiny
E2M2 - Double Trouble
E2M3 - Foxy Foxy
E2M4 - Ladies Night
E2M5 - Freddy's Circus
E2M6 - GOLDEN FREDDY(10/20)

-----------------
Common Issues
-----------------
"Waiting for player #"
It just means someone's computer hasn't fully loaded the level or their internet died.

"Out of sync with player #"
This can be caused 2 different ways.
1.The files are of a different version than the host's(Can be FNAF,or Doom itself!)
2.After time or lag spikes a netgame CAN desync, although it is rare. Usually longer than an hour
into the game. It is recommended for the host to have good internet and a good computer.
NOTE:IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO *NOT* ALT-TAB OUT OF THE GAME WHILE IN MULTIPLAYER.

--------------------------
RECOMMENDED COMPUTER SPECS
--------------------------
Quad core 2.4GHZ
An 'okay' video card. literally that simple.
4GB of Ram or greater.
These are literally ball parked. Chances are lower spec'd computers can run it. Who knows.

There will be future updates, fear not! Release or not I'm not done with this mod.
